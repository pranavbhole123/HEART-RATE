In this project i copied a code for motion amplification from a source and modified it further to calculate the heart beat from the vodeo input to the python program.
to run the folloe=wing program just set up an conda environment containing all the neede libraries along with NVIDIA CUDA.
and then run the commmand python face - f video.pm4.

Basically what this code does is it amplifies the blue green and red light from our face that is captured on camera but not visible to the naked eyes.
As the bloodflow in the body is periodic the captured output too is periodic. And one can deduce ones heartbeat from it .
I have uploaded the motion amplified frames for reference.
